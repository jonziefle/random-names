# random-names
This application generates random names using letter frequency distributions. There are two current versions used: **simple** and **complex**.

## Simple Names
Simple names are generated based on average frequencies of each letter, based on a specific language. Frequency data used was found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency

## Complex Names
Complex names are generated using average frequencies for consecutive letters. Data for this calculation was found for English: http://www.prooffreader.com/2014/09/how-often-does-given-letter-follow.html
